what about simulation???


## Why robotics as a career?

Don't be mistaken! R&D in robotics definitely requires solid and specialized technical background (e.g., representation of 3D rigid-body motion, ...).
In fact, it is an amazing place to utilize your creative mind for tackling many challenges in our society.

Relevant to the society! real-world problems, constantly in need for solutions
For a long time, many people like me could only associate real-world robotics 
with those sturdy industrial robots repeatedly picking and placing workpieces in factories.
Nowadays, robots are gaining traction beyond manufacturing:
self-driving cars, 
floor cleaning robots, 
Amazon's warehouse robots, 
just to name a few.
Many of the tasks fulfilled by these robots are dull, dirty, and/or dangerous,

Indeed, robots are taking away some of the mundane jobs used to be performed by human.
On the other hand, robots have also transformed the roles of many existing human worker,
for example, into "teaching" the robots (specifically, those kinds of robots are called Collaborative Robots, aka cobots) to perform diverse tasks.

Meanwhile, more job opportunities in robotics emerge, especially in R&D, 
to expand and enhance robots' capabilities.
Wondering what roboticists are researching on? Glad you asked, and the talk by Dr. Jeremy Wyatt explains the three waves of (mainstream) robotics quite well. 
Have a look.

		1. first wave: structured manipulation
		2. 2nd wave: probabilistic AI in mobile robots (navigation)
		3. 3rd wave: unstructured manipulation

personal fulfillment:
challenging,
interdisciplinary

lots of smart collegue 

# My research areas

the funny DARPA challenges

unlock the potential
human-level manipulation!

What's next
* the use of tactile sensing
* intelligent 



structured environment, ..., ... autonomous driving, ...

Currently, I am pursuing a career in robotics.



Bachelor degree in mechanical engineering

M.Sc degree in "Commercial Vehicle Technology". 
More precisely, my specializations are mechatronics and robotics.
