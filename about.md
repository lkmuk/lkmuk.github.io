Hi! Welcome to my website.
My name is Lai-Kan Muk.
I am a roboticist.
What brings me to this profession?
What is robotics really about in the first place?
Let me explain!

## What is robotics?

	Mention more my own experience? e.g., M.Sc. thesis
	First wave: Mention my first project MECH2907?
	What make grasping difficult?

If you think mainstream robotics is limited to those sturdy, fast-moving robots inside factories. 
You probably want to read on because there is much more in robotics!

A long time ago, when I was still an undergrad in mechanical engineering, 
I could only associate real-world robotics with industrial robots in factories.
We can refer to the tasks performed by these robots as **structured manipulation**
in the sense that during operation, all relevant aspects are already known, e.g.,

* the workpieces, which are the target objects to be manipulated,  
* where to retrieve and place them, and
* obstacles in the workspace, if any (e.g., think about a robot welding a car frame), etc.

As long as the operating environments are maintained to conform to these specifications, 
these robots don’t need a brain to reason on these aspects. 
In fact, most industrial robots are blind and merely follow pre-programmed motion sequences. 
A pretty mature technology from the 20th century, which does quite well for mass production, 
so why should I ever care about research in robotics? 
Not really... For the past decades, mainstream robotics has evolved considerably beyond structured manipulation.

My perception began to change during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
While attending lectures on machine learning and computer vision (which are closely related to robotics), 
I discovered the emerging "second wave" — **mobility in unstructured environments** (roughly corresponding to self-driving cars). 
Since then, I have completed a few projects on different aspects of robotics and got hooked on robotics. 
Are you curious about the technologies behind the second wave? 
Then, you probably want to dig deeper with the following materials.
* "Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots" by Roland Siegwart, Illah Reza Nourbakhsh, and Davide Scaramuzza
* "Probabilistic Robotics" by Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard, and Dieter Fox
* [Online training by Cyrill Stachniss from the University of Bonn](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/online-training-robotics/)


What’s next in robotics? 
One big theme is **unstructured manipulation**, also referred to as the third wave in the talk. 
Often, we also imply autonomous operation.
Given the trend of the aging population worldwide, the Great Resignation, etc., 
we shall not underestimate its benefits to society. 
Think about agriculture, construction, elderly care, etc. 
Moreover, it opens up many new opportunities like more capable rovers for space exploration, more flexible factories, robots doing all kinds of housework…

There are still numerous unsolved technical challenges in truly autonomous unstructured manipulation. 
Those robots still struggle to perform many tasks trivial to animals, 
say grasping a random object lying on a table, tightening a screw, etc. 
In the former case, humans can accomplish this quickly and almost without failure,
whereas achieving this with an autonomous robot remains difficult.
However, with more intelligent software controlling these robots, more powerful computers, the growing touch sensing, etc., 
the prospect of realizing unstructured manipulation continues to grow. 
So why not join this vibrant field?

Autonomous unstructured manipulation entails more sophisticated software and hardware compared to autonomous mobility.
Robots hardware, to reach and interact with diverse objects, 
robots often have a mobile base and at least one manipulator.
When interacting with objects occluded from cameras, novel sensing modalities like tactile sensors, can also be crucial for interacting with the environment.
Many Autonomously manipulating the environment also requires some understanding 
This means the robot should be intelligent enough

## About this website

If you share a similar mindset, you probably will find robotics exciting too! 
But you might not be lucky enough to know this! 
And nothing resonates with me better than first-hand experience. 
This is why I am writing this website to share my experience in robotics! 
This site also allows me to present my projects to my family and friends in greater depth. 
No matter who you are, I hope you find this website interesting!
